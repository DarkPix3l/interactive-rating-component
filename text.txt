 rating.style.opacity = "0"
          //rating.style.visibility = 'hidden';
          /*        Potential Bug:  adding an event listener to rating after setting visibility: hidden, but since visibility is not an animatable property, the transitionend event may not fire consistently. */


          thanks.style.visibility = 'visible';
            /* The issue is that visibility changes (hidden or visible) do not trigger the transitionend event in CSS. The transition property only works on animatable properties like opacity, transform, etc., but not visibility. */


             { once: true }); // `once: true` ensures the event listener runs only once
